# NetApp Flocker Driver (Coming soon!)

A native Flocker driver that allows you to use Flocker with clustered Data ONTAP.

The driver will be available in this repository soon. Meanwhile, you can view a [demo of the driver in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pdgsNJMrEc), or visit us at VMworld 2015 US!

And if you have an OpenStack deployment, you can make use of [our Cinder integration](http://netapp.github.io/openstack/2015/08/26/Flocker-Cinder/index.html) with Data ONTAP and E-Series platforms today!
